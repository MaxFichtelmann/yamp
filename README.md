Yet another Message Protocol

----------------------------

A library that helps to decouple RPC from the transport of the serialized messages.

This library may be for you if:

* You process messages that are transported on different channels (i.e. http, websockets, kafka etc.)
* You want to be able to change the way how messages are transported.
